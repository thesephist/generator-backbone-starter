# generator-backbone-starter

Yeoman generator generator for a Backbone-compatible version of thesephist/starter, a lightweight web application boilerplate. The project is a generator form of the original static PWA boilerplate at [github.com/thesephist/starter](github.com/thesephist/starter).

## Install

Install the Yeoman generator with `npm install` or `npm link`, and make sure `yo` is also installed. Then run `yo` to invoke the Yeoman.
